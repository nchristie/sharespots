# Contributing Guidelines
1. Always start by picking a ticket from the backlog. Please chat in Slack if you really want to pick something up and mentors can advise if it seems suitable. If you prefer to be assigned something based on your level that is great too!
4. Assign an issue to yourself and start working. All changes must be done on a branch so you can raise a PR.
5. Once ready, please raise a Pull Request to `develop` branch.

## How to raise a Pull Request
If you are new to [Git](), please take some time to familiarise yourself with Git and Github flow:

- [Git offical documentation](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Introduction to Git & Github slides](http://slides.com/lilianakastilio/github)

- [Interactive branching guide](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

In order to raise a Pull Request with your changes (please make sure all changes are done on a branch):
- Save and commit your changes (If you don't know how to do this start with an [introduction to Git & Github](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mk_3mW1nHG4WrtTQcmPH5oCCrbgNIoTcegFk398K8OE/edit))
- Push your changes and create a pull request: `git push origin your_branch_name`

- Describe all the changes you have made in details and save.

# A few simple rules
Please make sure you follow the current naming, coding and language conventions by reviewing the existing code and the existing way of working with the team.
If you are unsure of anything please ask, mentors are always here to help!
